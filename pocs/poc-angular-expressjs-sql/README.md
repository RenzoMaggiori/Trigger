This proof of concept (**POC**) demonstrates the integration of three technologies, `Angular`, `ExpressJS`, and `SQL` to create full-stack web application. Using `Angular` for the frontend, `ExpressJS` for the backend and `SQL` as its database.

# Angular

### What is Angular

`Angular` is a TypeScript-based framework for building client-side applications. Developed by Google, it excels at creating robust, scalable single-page applications (SPAs) with rich, dynamic user interfaces.

| ✅ Pros | ❎ Cons |
|:---:|:---:|
| Provides a **complete framework** for building applications, including **routing**, **state management**, and **HTTP client** | Steeper learning curve due to its **complexity** |
| Strong **two-way data binding** for real-time data updates | Can be **overkill** for small projects |
| Excellent **documentation** and long-term **community support** | Larger **bundle size** compared to other frontend frameworks |
| Powerful **dependency injection** system | Requires more **boilerplate** code for setting up simple projects |


### Why not Angular

- **Steep Learning Curve:** Compared to comparable frameworks like React or Vue, Angular's complicated architecture, which includes ideas like `dependency injection`, `modules`, and `decorators`.

- **Performance Overhead:** Angular's two-way data binding and bigger bundle size might have a detrimental effect on performance, particularly in large applications.

- **Code-heavy and rigid:** Due to Angular's strict design patterns and predefined structure, we often need to write extra code, resulting in less flexibility for those who prefer a more streamlined or customized development approach.

# ExpressJS
ExpressJS strikes the ideal mix between ease of use, adaptability, and speed, which makes it a fantastic option for developing REST APIs without compromising on scalability or maintainability.

# SQL
SQL databases are an excellent option, especially those with a high demand for data reliability and integrity, as they are outstanding at managing structured data, guaranteeing data consistency, executing complicated queries, and supporting transactional processes.
